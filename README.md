# Anomaly Detection Using ARIMA Model

ARIMA, which stands for Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, is a class of statistical models that are particularly suited for time series forecasting. These models provide a suite of functions that are powerful and flexible, making them a popular choice for many time series forecasting tasks.

In machine learning, ARIMA models output predictions that are linearly dependent on previous values, combined with stochastic factors. This makes them a powerful tool for predicting future values based on historical data.

## Choosing an ARIMA Model

When choosing an appropriate time series forecasting model, it's important to visualize the data to analyze trends, seasonalities, and cycles. If seasonality is a strong feature of your time series data, you might need to consider a model such as Seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA).

ARIMA models work by using a distributed lag model, where algorithms predict future values based on lagged values.

## Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection is the identification of unexpected events in a process. These anomalies could represent threats to our systems that may cause harm in terms of security or leakage of important information. However, the importance of anomaly detection extends beyond security. It's used to detect any event that doesn't conform to our expectations.

In this repository, we use the ARIMA model for anomaly detection, providing a practical example of its use in machine learning.
